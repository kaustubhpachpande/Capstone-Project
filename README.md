# Capstone-Project: From Spreadsheets to Storyboards in Healthcare Analytics
- Explored hospital performance using The Leapfrog Group’s dataset, focusing on patient safety indicators, patient-to-bed ratio (overcrowding), nurse staffing levels, and billing legal action taken across 2,000+ institutions.
- Built QuickSight dashboards to track and compare hospital trends by region, teaching status, and safety grade, providing stakeholders with a visual-first tool to assess systemic risks.
- Performed inferential analysis in RStudio to test hypotheses around hospital overcrowding and legal billing actions, uncovering insights into the operational and ethical strain on facilities.
- Identified how high nurse-to-patient ratios coincided with spikes in infections and legal billing disputes—enabling targeted investigations into patient safety breakdowns.
-   Project includes QuickSight Dashboard, R scripts, and review paper.
